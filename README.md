digital twists.

## 24 HR

The face has all 24 hours on it.

You read it by starting on the bottom and going clockwise

## One hand

* There's only 1 hand
* There are ticks every 15 minutes when the hand is nearby

Additionally, there's a red "minute tick" that rotates around the clock to help
judge the specific minute.

## "Progress Bar"

Theres a day progress bar that follows the hand around the clock. This kind of
shows how much 'progress' through the day is completed.

This changes colors based on the time of the day.
